  Easily send and receive Product Carbon Footprints

%p
  The PCFer lets you automatically send and receive Product Carbon Footprint
  (PCF) reports in the standard PACT format. PCFs can be sent between two
  companies who are both running PCFer, or you can accept them from, or send
  them to, any system which accepts the common PACT format.

%p
  To send a PCF to one of your <b>customers</b>, get the API endpoint and key of
  their software sytem, and create a Customer account for them. Then create your
  PCF, select the customer, and hit "Send PCF." That's it!

%p
  To receive PCFs from a vendor, create a Vendor account for them, which creates
  and API endpoint and unique API key which you can send the vendor. They can
  then use those to send you a PCF at any time.

%p
  To invite someone in your own company</b> to use this tool, use the
  <i>invite</i> link to sent them an invitation to create an internal user
  account, as distinct from a customer account.
